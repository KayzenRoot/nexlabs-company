# NexLabs Company Source Hierarchy

Status: `CANONICAL`

Authority is resolved by domain. A newer file does not automatically override an approved canonical source.

| Priority | Domain | Canonical source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Current state | `CHECKPOINT.md`, `CHECKPOINT.json`, exact Git/GitHub state |
| 2 | Decisions | `DECISIONS-LEDGER.md` and accepted ADRs |
| 3 | Scope | `SCOPE.md` and the active admitted Work Order |
| 4 | Completion | `DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md` |
| 5 | Architecture | `ARCHITECTURE.md` and accepted architecture ADRs |
| 6 | Requirements | `REQUIREMENTS.md` |
| 7 | Security | `SECURITY.md` |
| 8 | Validation | `TEST-BENCHMARK-PLAN.md` plus exact-head evidence |
| 9 | Deployment | `DEPLOYMENT.md` |
| 10 | Future work | `BACKLOG.md`, Work Order Registry and GitHub issues |
| 11 | Conversation | transient context only |

If canonical sources conflict, are missing, stale, or bound to another Git head, stop the affected progression and reconcile through the active Work Order. Never infer approval from chat history.
